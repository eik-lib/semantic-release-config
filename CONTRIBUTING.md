# Contributing

Thank you for showing an interest in contributing to Eik ðŸ§¡

This module is a [shared config for Semantic Release](https://semantic-release.gitbook.io/semantic-release/usage/shareable-configurations). We accept changes that should apply to all repositories in the [eik-lib origanisation](https://github.com/eik-lib).

Commits should follow the [conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) format.

A change in configuration is considered a `patch` in [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/). A new export would be a `minor`. Requiring a new major of `semantic-release` would be a `major`.

This repo uses Semantic Release to automate releases whenever changes are merged to the default branch.
